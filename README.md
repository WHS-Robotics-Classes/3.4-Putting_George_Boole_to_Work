# 3.4-Putting George Boole to Work
## One of the fundamental concepts of robotics is decision making.  Without Boolean logic and math our systems cannot make decisions.  `for()` and `while()` loops will allow us to begin to do some interesting things.

### Step One: Build the Prototype
Create the following prototype on your breadboard:
![Boole prototype]()

### Step Two: Review `for()`
Read [this reference page](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/control-structure/for/) about the new function we are learning.  

### Step Three: Write the Code
Write a sketch that



There is some starter code above to help.

See the video here for an example: 

[![Lab 3.3 Prototype](http://img.youtube.com/vi/riyNHcp8Qs4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riyNHcp8Qs4 "Lab 3.3 Prototype")

### Step Four: Debug and Submit
Make sure your prototype behaves the same way as the one in the video. As in the previous assignment, make a new file here on GitHub. Name it 3.3_Utilizing_analogWrite.ino and Commit it to the repository.

REMEMBER: THIS ASSIGNMENT REQUIRES BOTH A VIDEO OF YOUR PROTOTYPE AND CODE SUBMITTED ON GITHUB
